# Note Taker Application

An application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

This is a very fun challenge to make! I specifically had some difficulty getting my notes to save. After a couple of debugging, it finally saved! Hope you enjoy it!
